- [ ] I have read the [wiki page](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/wiki) and [cheat sheet](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/wiki/Cheat-Sheet), but there is no information I need.
- [ ] I have searched in [existing issues](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue), but did not find a same one.
- [ ] I want to reoprt a problem instead of asking a question. It'd better to use [kingfisher tag in Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kingfisher) to ask a question.
