    /// something like url mapping.

    ///   - task: The current `SessionDataTask` which triggers this redirect.
    ///   - response: The response received during redirection.
    ///   - newRequest: The request for redirection which can be modified.
    ///   - completionHandler: A closure for being called with modified request.
