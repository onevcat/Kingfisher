#### Fix
* Increate iOS minimum supported version from 10 to 12, to fix Xcode 13 build issue. [#1725](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/1725)

---

## [6.3.1 - Published Wrapper](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/6.3.1) (2021-08-03)

#### Fix
* An issue which causes runtime crash on `@Published` metadata when using Kingfisher on iOS 12 in some certain rare cases. [#1717](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/1717)

---

## [6.3.0 - Open To Better](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/6.3.0) (2021-04-21)

#### Add
* Mark `SessionDelegate` as public to allow a subclass to take over the delegate methods from session tasks. [#1658](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1658)
* A new `imageDownloader(_:didDownload:with:)` in `ImageDownloaderDelegate` to pass not only `Data` but also the whole `URLResponse` to delegate method. Now you can determine how to handle these data based on the received response. [#1676](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1676)
* An option `autoExtAfterHashedFileName` in `DiskStorage.Config` to allow appending the file extension extracted from the cache key. [#1671](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1671)

#### Fix
* Now the GIF continues to play in a collection view cell with highlight support. [#1685](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1685)
* Fix a crash when loading GIF files with lots of frames in `AnimatedImageView`. Thanks for contribution from @wow-such-amazing [#1686](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1686)

---

## [6.2.1 - Spring Release Fix](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/6.2.1) (2021-03-09)

#### Fix
* Revert changes for the external delegate in [#1620](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1620), which caused some image resource loading failing due to a CFNetwork internal error.

---

## [6.2.0 - Spring Release](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/6.2.0) (2021-03-08)

#### Add
* The backend of Kingfisher's cache solution, `DiskStorage` and `MemoryStorage`, are now marked as `public`. So you can use them standalone in your project. [#1649](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1649)
* An `imageFrameCount` property in image view extensions. It holds the frame count of an animated image if available. [#1647](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1647)
* A new `extraSessionDelegateHandler` in `ImageDownloader`. Now you can receive the related session task delegate method by registering an external delegate object. [#1620](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1620)
* A new method `loadImmediately` for `KFImage` to start the load manually. It is useful if you want to load the image before `onAppear` is called.

#### Fix
* Drop the use of `@State` for keeping image across `View` update for `KFImage`. This should fix some SwiftUI internal crash when setting the image in `KFImage`. [#1642](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1642)
* The image reference in `ImageBinder` now is marked with `weak`. This helps release memory quicker in some cases. [#1640](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1640)

---

## [6.1.1 - SwiftUI Issues](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/6.1.1) (2021-02-17)

#### Fix
* Remove unnecessary queue dispatch when setting image result. This prevents image flickering when some situation. [#1615](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1615)
* Now the `KF` builder methods also accept optional `URL` or `Source`. It aligns the syntax with the normal view extension methods. [#1617](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1617)
* Fix an issue that wrong hash is calculated for `ImageBinder`. It might cause view state lost for a `KFImage`. [#1624](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1624)
* Now the `ImageCache` will disable the disk storage when there is no free space on disk when creating the cache folder, instead of just crashing it. [#1628](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1628)
* A workaround for `@State` lost when using a view inside another container in a `Lazy` stack or grid. [#1631](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1631)
* Performance improvement for images with an non-up orientation in Exif when displaying in `KFImage`. [#1629](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1629)

---

## [6.1.0 - SwiftUI Rework](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/6.1.0) (2021-02-01)

#### Add
* Rewrite state management for `KFImage`. Now the image reloading works in a more stable way without task dispatching. [#1604](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1604)
* Add `fade` and `forceTransition` modifier to `KFImage` to support built-in fade in effect when loading image in SwiftUI. [#1604](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1604)

#### Fix
* When an `ImageModifier` is applied, the modified image is not cached to memory cache anymore. The `ImageModifier` is intended to be used just before setting the image to a view and now it works as expected. [#1612](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1612)
* Now `SwiftUI` and `Combine` are declared as weak link in podspec. This is a workaround for [some rare case build issue](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60198305). It does not affect supported deploy version of Kingfisher. [#1607](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1607)
* Remove header file from podspec to allow Kingfisher built as a static framework in a Swift-ObjC mixed project. [#1608](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1608)

---

## [6.0.1 - Bind & Hug](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/6.0.1) (2021-01-05)

#### Fix
* Start the binder again when `KFImage` initialized, to keep the same behavior as previous versions. [#1594](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/1594)

---

## [6.0.0 - New Year 2021](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/6.0.0) (2021-01-03)

#### Add
* A `KF` shorthand to create image setting tasks and config them. It provides a cleaner and modern way to use Kingfisher. Now, instead of using `imageView.kf.setImage(with:options:)`, you can perform chain-able invocation with `KF` helpers. For example, the code below is identical. [#1546](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1546)

    ```swift
    // Old way
    imageView.kf.setImage(
      with: url,
      placeholder: localImage,
      options: [.transition(.fade(1)), .loadDiskFileSynchronously],
      progressBlock: { receivedSize, totalSize in
          print("progressBlock")
      },
      completionHandler: { result in
          print(result)
      }
    )

    // New way
    KF.url(url)
      .placeholder(localImage)
      .fade(duration: 1)
      .loadDiskFileSynchronously()
      .onProgress { _ in print("progressBlock") }
      .onSuccess { result in print(result) }
      .onFailure { err in print("Error: \(err)") }
      .set(to: imageView)
    ```
    
* Similar to `KF`, The `KFImage` for SwiftUI is now having the similar chain-able syntax to setup an image task and options. This makes the `KFImage` APIs closer to the way how SwiftUI code is written. [#1586](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1586)
* Add support for `TVMonogramView` on tvOS. [#1571](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1571)
* Some important properties and method in `AnimatedImageView.Animator` are marked as `public` now. It provides some useful information of the decoded GIF files. [#1575](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1575)
* An `AsyncImageDownloadRequestModifier` to support modifying the request in an asynchronous way. [#1589](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1589/files)
* Add a `.lowDataMode` option to support for Low Data Mode. When the `.lowDataMode` option is provided with an alternative source (usually a low-resolution version of the original image), Kingfisher will respect user's Low Data Mode setting and download the alternative image instead. [#1590](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1590)

#### Fix
* An issue that importing AppKit wrongly in a macCatalyst build. [#1547](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1547/commits/096498f7798a6fd34c70efc6f80014dfc6d8a9b7)

#### Remove
* Deprecated types, methods and properties are removed. If you are still using `Kingfisher.Image`, `Kingfisher.ImageView` or `Kingfisher.Button`, use the equivalent `KFCrossPlatform` types (such as `KFCrossPlatformImage`, etc) instead. Please make sure you do not have any warnings before migrate to Kingfisher v6. For more about the removed deprecated things, check [#1525](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1525/files).
* The standalone framework target of SwiftUI support is removed. Now the SwiftUI support is a part in the main Kingfisher library. To upgrade to v6, first remove `Kingfisher/SwiftUI` subpod (if you are using CocoaPods) or remove the `KingfisherSwiftUI` target (if you are using Carthage or Swift Package Manager), then reinstall Kingfisher. [#1574](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1574)

---

## [5.15.8 - KFImage handler](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.15.8) (2020-11-27)

#### Fix
* An issue caused the `onSuccess` handler not be called when the image is already cached. [#1570](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1570)

---

## [5.15.7 - Cancel Lock](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.15.7) (2020-10-29)

#### Fix
* A potential crash when cancelling image downloading task while accessing its original request on iOS 13 or earlier. [#1558](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1558)

---

## [5.15.6 - ImageBinder Callback](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.15.6) (2020-10-11)

#### Fix
* Prevent main queue dispatching in `ImageBinder` if it is already on main thread. This prevents unintended flickering when reloading. [#1551](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1551)

---

## [5.15.5 - Cancelling Fix](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.15.5) (2020-09-29)

#### Fix
* A possible fix for the crashes when cancelling a huge amount of image tasks too fast. [#1537]

---

## [5.15.4 - Farewell Objective-C (CocoaPods)](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.15.4) (2020-09-24)

#### Fix
* Give `SessionDelegate` an Objective-C name so it can work with other libraries even added by a dependency which generates Objective-C header. [#1532](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1532)

---

## [5.15.3 - Farewell Objective-C](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.15.3) (2020-09-21)

#### Fix
* Removed the unnecessary ObjC header generating and module defining due to Xcode 12 is now generating conflicted types even for different libraries. [#1517](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/1517)
* Set deploy target for SwiftUI target and its pod spec to iOS 10 and macOS 10.12, which aligns to the settings of core framework. That resolves some dependency issues when using CocoaPods for both app target and extension targets. But it does not mean you can use the SwiftUI support on those minimal target. All related APIs are still unavailable on old system versions. [#1524](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1524)

---

## [5.15.2 - Xcode 11 Revived](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.15.2) (2020-09-19)

#### Fix
* Fix a build error introduced by the previous SwiftUI fix for Xcode 12. Now Xcode 11 can also build the KingfisherSwiftUI target. [#1515](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1515)

---

## [5.15.1 - SwiftUI Layout](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.15.1) (2020-09-16)

#### Fix
* A workaround for a SwiftUI issue that embedding an image view inside the `List` > `NavigationLink` > `HStack` hierarchy could crash the app on iOS 14. [#1508](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/1508)

---

## [5.15.0 - Video and Text Attachment](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.15.0) (2020-08-17)

#### Add
* An `AVAssetImageDataProvider` to generate an image from a remote video asset at a specified time. All the processing gets benefits from current existing Kingfisher technologies, such as cache and image processors. [#1500](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1500)
* New extension methods on `NSTextAttachment` to load an image from network for an attachment. [#1495](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1495)
* A general clear cache method which combines clearing for memory cache and disk cache. [#1494](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1494)

#### Fix
* Now the sample app has a new look and supports dark mode, finally. [#1496](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1496)

---

## [5.14.1 - Summer Fix](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.14.1) (2020-07-06)

#### Fix
* Early return if no valid animator in an `AnimatedImageView`. This prevents a CGImage rendering issue displaying a static image. [#1428](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/1428)
* Enable Define Module setting to generate module map. So Kingfisher could be used in libraries imported to Objective-C projects. [#1451](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1451)
* A fix to workaround on implicitly initializer of queue that might cause a crash. [#1449](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/1449)
* Improve the disk cache performance by avoiding unnecessary disk operations. [#1480](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1480)

---

## [5.14.0 - Retry Strategy](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.14.0) (2020-05-13)

#### Add
* A `.retryStrategy` option and associated `RetryStrategy` to define a highly customizable retry mechanism in Kingfisher. [#1424]
* Built-in `DelayRetryStrategy` to provide a most common used retry strategy implementation. It simplifies the normal retry requirement when downloading an image from network. [#1447](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1447)
* Now you can set the round corner radius for a `RoundCornerImageProcessor` in a fraction way. This is useful when you do not know the desire image view size, but still want to clip any received image to a certain round corner ratio (such as a circle for any image). [#1443](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1443)
* Add an `isLoaded` binding to `KFImage` to follow SwiftUI pattern better. [#1429](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1429)

#### Fix
* An issue that `.imageModifier` option not working on an `ImageProvider` provided image. [#1435](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1435)
* A workaround for making xcframework continue to work when exported with Swift 5.2 compiler and Xcode 11.4. [#1444](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1444)

---

## [5.13.4 - Build Configurations](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.13.4) (2020-04-11)

#### Fix
* Expose all build configurations in Package.swift file for Swift Package Manager. Now you can choose the linking style by yourself. [#1426](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1426)

---

## [5.13.3 - Dynamic SPM](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.13.3) (2020-04-01)

#### Fix
* Allows Carthage to build this library for macOS. [#1413](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1413)
* Explicitly specify to build as a dynamic framework for Swift Package Manager. [#1420](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1420)

---

## [5.13.2 - KFImage Orientation](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.13.2) (2020-02-28)

#### Fix
* An issue for `KFImage` when resizing images with different EXIF orientation other than top. [#1396](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1396)
* A race condition when setting `CacheCallbackCoordinator` state. [#1394](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1394)
* Move an `@objc` attribute to prevent warnings in Xcode 11.4.

---

## [5.13.1 - Internal Warning](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.13.1) (2020-02-17)

#### Fix
* Fix an unused variable warning which is on by default in Xcode 11.4 and Swift 5.2, which makes CocoaPods angry when compiling. [#1393](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1393)

---

## [5.13.0 - New Year 2020](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.13.0) (2020-01-17)

#### Add
* Mark `DefaultCacheSerializer` as `public` and enables the ability of original data caching. [#1373](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1373/)
* Add image compression quality parameter to `DefaultCacheSerializer`. [#1372](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1372/)
* A new `contentURL` property in `ImageDataProvider` to provide a URL when it makes sense. [#1386](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1386/)

#### Fix
* Now, local file URLs can be loaded as `Resource`s without converted to `LocalFileImageDataProvider` explicitly. [#1386](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1386/)

---

## [5.12.0 - White Overflow](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.12.0) (2019-12-13)

#### Add
* Two error cases under `KingfisherError.CacheErrorReason` to give out the detail error information and reason when a failure happens when caching the file on disk. Check `.cannotCreateCacheFile` and `.cannotSetCacheFileAttribute` if you need to handle these errors. [#1365](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1365)

#### Fix
* A 32-bit `Int` overflow when calculating expiration duration when a large `days` value is set for `StorageExpiration`. [#1371](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1371)
* The build config for SwiftUI sub-pod now only applies to the KingfisherSwiftUI scheme. [#1368](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1368)

---

## [5.11.0 - macCatalyst](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.11.0) (2019-11-30)

#### Add
* Support macCatalyst platform when building with Carthage. [#1356](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1356)

#### Fix
* Fix an issue that image orientation not correctly applied when an image processor used. [#1358](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1358)

---

## [5.10.1 - Repeat Count](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.10.1) (2019-11-20)

#### Fix
* Fix a wrong calculation of `repeatCount` of `AnimatedImageView`. Now it can play correct count for an animated image. [#1350](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1350)
* Make sure to skip disk cache when `fromMemoryCacheOrRefresh` set. [#1351](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1351)
* Fix a issue which prevents building with Xcode 10. [#1353](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1353)

---

## [5.10.0 - Rex Rabbit](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.10.0) (2019-11-17)

#### Add
* An `.alternativeSources` option to provide a list of alternative image loading `Source`s. These `Source`s act as a fallback when the original `Source` downloading fails where Kingfisher will try to load images from. [#1343](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1343)

#### Fix
* The `.waitForCache` option now also waits for caching for original image if the `.cacheOriginalImage` is also set. [#1344](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1344)
* Now the `retrieveImage` methods in `ImageCache` calls its `callbackQueue` is `.mainCurrentOrAsync` by default instead of `.untouch`. It aligns the behavior of other parts in the framework. [#1338](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1338)
* An issue that causes customize indicator not being placed with correct size. [#1345](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1345)
* Performance improvement for loading progressive images. [#1332](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1332)

---

## [5.9.0 - Combination](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.9.0) (2019-10-24)

#### Add
* Introduce a `|>` operator for combining image processors. [#1320](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1320)

#### Fix
* Improve performance of reading task identifier when handling downloading side effect. [#1310](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1310)
* Improve some type conversion to boost building. [#1321](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1321)

---

## [5.8.3 - Carthage Cache](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.8.3) (2019-10-09)

#### Fix
* Generate Objective-C header to make carthage cache work again. [#1308](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1308)

---

## [5.8.2 - Game of Thrones](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.8.2) (2019-10-04)

#### Fix
* Fix broken semantic versioning introduced by 5.8.0. [#1304](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1304)
* Remove implicit animations in SwiftUI when a `.fade` animation applied in the option. Now Kingfisher respect all animations set by users instead of overwriting it internally. [#1301](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1301)
* Now project uses KingfisherSwiftUI with Swift Package Manager can be archived correctly. [#1300](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1300)

---

## [5.8.1 - Borderless](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.8.1) (2019-09-27)

#### Fix
* Remove the unexpected border in `KFImage` while loading the image. [#1293](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1293)

---

## [5.8.0 - Xcode 11 & SwiftUI](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.8.0) (2019-09-25)

#### Add
* Add support for Swift Package Manager. Now you can build and use Kingfisher with SPM under Xcode 11 and use it in all targets.
* Add support for iPad Apps for Mac. You can use Kingfisher's UIKit extensions (like `UIImage` and `UIImageView`) on a catalyst project.
* Add support for SwiftUI. Build and import KingfisherSwiftUI.framework or contain the "Kingfisher/SwiftUI" subpod, then you can use `KFImage` to load image asynchronously. `KFImage` provides a similar interface as `View.Image`.
* Add support for building as a binary framework. A zipped file containing `xcframework` and related dSYMs is provided in the release page.
* A `diskCacheAccessExtendingExpiration` option to give more control of disk cache extending behavior. [#1287](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1287)
* Combine all targets into one. Now Kingfisher is a cross-platform target and you need to specify an SDK to build it.

#### Fix
* Rename too generic typealias names in Kingfisher, to avoid conflicting with SwiftUI types. Original `Kingfisher.Image` is now `Kingfisher.KFCrossPlatformImage`. The similar rules are applied to other cross-platform typealias too, such as `Kingfisher.View`, `Kingfisher.Color` and more.
* A potential thread issue in `taskIdentifier` which might cause a crash when using data provider. [#1276](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1276)
* An issue that causes memory shortage when a large number of network images are loaded in a short time. [#1270](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1270)

---

## [5.7.1 - Thread Things](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.7.1) (2019-08-11)

#### Fix
* Setting `runLoopMode` for `AnimatedImageView` will trigger animation restart normally. [#1253](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1253)
* A possible thread issue when removing storage object from memory cache by the cache policy. [#1255](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1255)
* Manipulating on `AnimateImageView`'s frame array is now thread safe. [#1257](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1257)

---

## [5.7.0 - Summer Bird](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.7.0) (2019-07-03)

#### Add
* Mark `cacheFileURL(forKey:)` of `DiskStorage` to public. [#1214](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/1214)
* Mark `KingfisherManager` initializer to public so other dependencies can customize the manager behavior. [#1216](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/1216)

#### Fix
* Performance improvement on progressive JPEG scanning. [#1218](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1218)
* Fix a potential thread issue when checking progressive JPEG. [#1220](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1220)

#### Remove
* The deprecated `Result` extensions for Swift 4 back compatibility are removed. [#1224](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1224)

* Add prebuilt binary framework when releasing to GitHub. Further supporting of fully compatible binary framework would come after Swift module stability. [#1194](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1194)

#### Fix
* Resizing performance for animated images should be improved dramatically. [#1189](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/1189)

---

## [5.0.0 - Reborn](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/releases/tag/5.0.0) (2018-12-08)

#### Add
* Add `Result` type to Kingfisher. Now all callbacks in Kingfisher are using `Result` instead of tuples. This is more future-friendly and provides a modern way to make error handling better.
* Make `KingfisherError` much more elaborate and accurate. Instead of simply provides the error code, now `KingfisherError` contains error reason and necessary associated values. It will help to understand and track the errors easier.
* Better cache management by separating memory cache and disk cache to their own storages. Now you can use `MemoryStorage` and `DiskStorage` as the `ImageCache` backend.
* Image cache of memory storage would be purged automatically in a certain time interval. This reduce memory pressure for other parts of your app.
* The `ImageCache` is rewritten from scratch, to get benefit from new created `MemoryStorage` and `DiskStorage`. At the same time, this hybrid cache abstract keeps most API compatibility from the earlier versions.
* Now the `ImageCache` can receive only raw `Data` object and cache it as needed.
* A `KingfisherParsedOptionsInfo` type to parse `KingfisherOptionsInfoItem`s in related API. This improves reusability and performance when handling options in Kingfisher.
* An option to specify whether an image should also prefetched to memory cache or not.
* An option to make the disk file loading synchronously instead of in its own I/O queue.
* Options to specify cache expiration for either memory cache or disk cache. This gives you a chance to control cache lifetime in a per-task grain size.
* Add a default maximum size for memory cache. Now only at most 25% of your device memory will be used to kept images in memory. You can also change this value if needed.
* An option to specify a processing queue for image processors. This gives your flexibility if you want to use main queue or if you want to dispatch the processing to a different queue.
* A `DownsamplingImageProcessor` for downsampling an image to a given size before loading it to memory.
* Add `ImageDataProvider` protocol to make it possible to provide image data locally instead of downloading from network. Several concrete types are provided to load images from data format. Use `LocalFileImageDataProvider` to load an image from a local disk path, `Base64ImageDataProvider` to load image from a Base64 string representation and `RawImageDataProvider` to provide a raw `Data object`.
* A general `Source` protocol to define from where the image should be loaded. Currently, we support to load an image from `ImageDataProvider` or from network now.

#### Fix
* Now CommonCrypto from system is used to calculate file name from cache key, instead of using a customized hash algorithm.
* An issue which causes `ImageDownloader` crashing when a lot of downloading tasks running at the same time.
* All operations like image pretching and data receiving should now be performed in non-UI threads correctly.
* Now `KingfisherCompatible` uses struct for `kf` namespacing for better performance.

See [Kingfisher 3.0 Migration Guide](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/wiki/Kingfisher-3.0-Migration-Guide) for more about how to migrate your project to 3.0. Kingfisher 2.6.x is still supporting both Swift 2.2 and 2.3.
* Image Processor. Now you can specify an image processor and it will be used to process images after downloaded. It is useful when you need to apply some transforming or filter to the image. You can also use the processor to support any other image format, like WebP. See [Processor](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/wiki/Cheat-Sheet#processor) section in the wiki for more. The default processor should behave the same as before. [#420](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/420)
* Built-in processors from simple round corner and resizing to filters like tint and blur. Check [Built-in processors of Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/wiki/Cheat-Sheet#built-in-processors-of-kingfisher) for more.
* Cache Serializer. [CacheSerializer](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/wiki/Cheat-Sheet#serializer) will be used to convert some data to an image object for retrieving from disk cache and vice versa for storing to disk cache.
* New indicator type. Now you should be able to use your own indicators. [#430](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/pull/430)
* ImageDownloadRequestModifier. Use this protocol to modify requests being sent to your server.

#### Fix
* Resource is now a protocol instead of a struct. Use `ImageResource` for your original `Resource` type. And now `URL` conforms `Resource` so the APIs could be clearer.
* Now Kingfisher cache will store re-encoded image data instead of the original data by default. This is needed due to we want to store the processed data from `ImageProcessor`. If this is not what you want, you should supply your customized instanse of `CacheSerializer`.

#### Remove
* KingfisherManager.init is removed since you should never create your own manager.
* cachedImageExistsforURL in `ImageCache` is removed since it introduced unnecessary coupling. Use `isImageCached` instead.
* requestModifier` is removed. Use `.requestModifier` and pass a `ImageDownloadRequestModifier`.
* kf_showIndicatorWhenLoading is removed since we have a better and flexible way to use indicator by `kf_indicatorType`.
