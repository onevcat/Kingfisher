                   Kingfisher is a lightweight and pure Swift implemented library for downloading and cacheing image from the web. It provides you a chance to use pure Swift alternation in your next app.

                   * Everything in Kingfisher goes asynchronously, not only downloading, but also caching. That means you can never worry about blocking your UI thread.
                   * Multiple-layer cache. Downloaded image will be cached in both memory and disk. So there is no need to download it again and this could boost your app dramatically.
                   * Cache management. You can set the max duration or size the cache could take. And the cache will also be cleaned automatically to prevent taking too much resource.
                   * Modern framework. Kingfisher uses `NSURLSession` and the latest technology of GCD, which makes it a strong and swift framework. It also provides you easy APIs to use.
                   * Cancellable processing task. You can cancel the downloading or retriving image process if it is not needed anymore.
                   * Independent components. You can use the downloader or caching system separately. Or even create your own cache based on Kingfisher's code.
                   * Options to decompress the image in background before render it, which could improve the UI performance.
                   * A category over `UIImageView` for setting image from an url directly.
